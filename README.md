# RTI Connector for Rust

## _This document is Work in Progress!!_

Everything is subject to change and may be incomplete or out of date.

## Quick Start

This crate is intended to be managed through Cargo as a Git repository. That is,
in order to add it to your project dependencies, you would do:

```console
cargo add \
    --git https://www.github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-rs \
    --branch <branch-name>
```

Where `<branch-name>` is the branch you want to use, e.g. `master` or a specific
in-development branch.

Once available, you can start using the crate in your rust code. Check the
quickstart located at [`snippets/quickstart.rs`](snippets/quickstart.rs) for a
simple example of how to use the Connector API.

### Note on Native Libraries

This crate requires the RTI Connector C libraries to be available both during build and at runtime.

At build time, the scripts in `build.rs` can attempt to download the required libraries from the
[RTI Connector releases in Github][rti-github-connector].

[rti-github-connector]: https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector/releases " RTI Connector Github repository"

You can opt-in to this behavior by setting the environment variable `RTI_CONNECTOR_VERSION` to the
desired version (e.g. `1.3.1`) before building your application with Cargo.

At runtime, you'll need to ensure that your system's linker can find the required libraries. This
usually involves placing the native libraries side-to-side with the executable or using your system's
dynamic library path environment variable (e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS,
or `PATH` on Windows).

## Examples

The crate includes a `shapes` example compatible with the RTI Shapes Demo.
This example can be run as a publisher or as a subscriber.

Additionally, it contains read-only snippets in the `snippets` module that
demonstrate various features of the Connector API, and are used in the
documentation.
