# A simple DDS API for Rust

The `rtiddsconnector` crate offers a lightweight interface to access DDS Domains
from Rust, using [RTI Connext][rti-pro]'s C libraries and the
simplified _RTI Connector_ API.

The API offered by `rtiddsconnector` does **NOT** match the
[standard DDS API][omg-dds], but it rather offers a simplified interface,
which was developed for faster and easier integration in any programming
language with access to native C code.

The [Github project page][gh-connector] contains more information about
`rtiddsconnector`'s C interface, and bindings to other languages (such as Javascript).
The most important characteristics of the _RTI Connector_ API are that:

* It is based on an external [XML configuration][omg-dds-xml] file which fully describes
  the DDS DomainParticipant and its contained entities (Types, Topics,
  DataReaders, DataWriters, etc.).
* It is based on top of Dynamic Data, thus removing the need for
  code generation steps typically required by DDS applications.
* It features implicit memory management for data samples, thus simplifying
  the application code.
* It features implicit data conversions between DDS primitive types and
  native types supported by the target programming language.

## Overview

The `rtiddsconnector` crate exposes the _RTI Connector_ API through the following main abstractions:

* [`Connector`]: Represents a DDS _DomainParticipant_, and is used to create
  `Input` and `Output` objects for reading and writing data.
* [`Input`]: Represents a DDS _DataReader_, and is used to read data samples
  from DDS topics.
* [`Output`]: Represents a DDS _DataWriter_, and is used to write data samples
  to DDS topics.

In addition to these main abstractions, the crate also exposes, among others, the following types:

* [`Sample`]: A trait representing a data sample read from an `Input`.
* [`SampleIterator`]: An iterator over valid samples read from an `Input`.
* [`Instance`]: A struct representing a data sample to be written to an `Output`.
* [`ConnectorError`]: A struct representing errors that can occur when using the Connector API.
* [`ConnectorResult`]: A type alias for `Result<T, ConnectorError>`, used for error handling.
* [`ConnectorFallible`]: A type alias for `Result<T, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`, used for fallible operations.
* [`GlobalsDropGuard`]: A struct that ensures proper cleanup of global resources used by the Connector API.

### Typed Data Support

This crate provides Serde-based serialization and deserialization support
for working with strongly-typed data structures instead of raw JSON.
It extends the `Instance` and `Sample` types with methods to serialize
Rust structs to JSON and deserialize JSON to Rust structs, respectively.

See the documentation for [`Instance::serialize`] and [`Sample::deserialize`].

### Error Handling

Because many operations in the Connector API can fail due to various reasons, most of them handled
externally in the underlying C implementation, the `rtiddsconnector` crate provides
the [`ConnectorError`] struct as an opaque representation of errors that can occur when using the API.

The [`ConnectorResult`] type alias is used throughout the crate to represent operations that can
succeed or fail with a [`ConnectorError`]. Most public methods in the crate return a [`ConnectorResult<T>`],
where `T` is the expected return type of the operation.

### Thread safety

The `rtiddsconnector` crate attempts to provide safe abstractions over the underlying
C implementation, which is not thread-safe. This means that while the crate attempts to use
Rust's safety guarantees, users must be careful when using multiple threads.

### Build time linking

Because `rtiddsconnector` is built on top of [RTI Connext][rti-pro] C libraries,
applications using this crate must ensure that the required C libraries are
available at runtime.

The `build.rs` script included in the crate can automatically configure
the linker to find the required libraries, namely:

1. If the `RTI_CONNECTOR_VERSION` environment variable is defined, it will attempt to download
   the target-specific C libraries from the [corresponding Github release][gh-connector-releases].
2. If the `RTI_CONNECTOR_DIR` environment variable is defined, it will use the C libraries
   found in the specified directory.
3. If neither of the above environment variables is defined, it will attempt to find the C libraries
   in a default location based on common installation paths.

If neither of these methods is successful, the build will fail with an error message
indicating that the C libraries could not be found.

Once your application has been built, `cargo` commands will automatically pick up the
linker instructions generated by `build.rs`, so no additional configuration is needed
to link the [RTI Connext][rti-pro] C libraries when using `cargo test` or similar.

However, when deploying your application, make sure that the required C libraries
are available in the system's library path, or in a location specified by
the appropriate environment variable (e.g., `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux,
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS, or `PATH` on Windows).
